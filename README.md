sunmap.wdgt
===========

A current view of daylight super-imposed on a mercator projection of the earth. In OS X Dashboard Widgetform!


Installation
============

1. Double click on the sunmap.wdgt


Hacking
=========

1. [Optional] Rename sunmap.wdgt to something else, like "sunmap". This will get Finder to treat it like the folder it is.
2. Make your changes.
3. [Optional] If you've already installed the widget, remove it and delete from the list of installed widgets.
4. [Optional] If you renamed the folder in step 1, rename it back to "sunmap.wdgt".
5. Follow installation steps.
